            The Rubik's Cube was invented in 1975 by the Hungarian teacher, Ern≈ë Rubik. He wanted to make a mechanism of
            independently moving parts that wouldn't fall apart. Later, in 1979 the cube was introduced at the Nuremberg toy
            fair in Germany.

            The cube was very popular and the company Ideal Toys signed a deal to manufacture and sell the
            cube worldwide. In 1980, the cube was sold internationally and the cube craze had begun! It was the most popular
            toy of the 1980s and has seen a significant revival in popularity in recent years.
